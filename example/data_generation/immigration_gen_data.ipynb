      "\"_answer\": \"In June 2007, the USCIS clarified what is considered to be equivalent to a U.S. master's degree for Employment-Based Category 2. Each petition and its supporting documentation are examined on a case-by-case basis and degree equivalencies are based on the evidence presented with the individual case. However, the below is provided as a general outline: 1. U.S. master's degree as long as it is in the field required, no additional document is required. 2. Four-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree (India) with degrees in the same or related fields, this will generally be considered the equivalent to a U.S. master's degree and no additional document is required. 3. Three-year bachelor's degree + three-year master's degree (India) with degrees in the same or related fields, this will generally be equivalent to a U.S. master's degree and no additional document is required. 4. Three-year bachelor's degree + one-year postgraduate diploma + two-year master's degree (India) with degrees in the same or similar field - this would generally be considered the equivalent of a bachelor's degree plus one additional year of education. Therefore, the beneficiary would also need to have five years' progressive experience. If the postgraduate diploma is determined to be progressive postgraduate education that is a continuation of the three-year bachelor's degree, it is possible that this would be considered the equivalent to a U.S. master's degree and there would be no need to establish five years' progressive experience. 5. Three-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree (India) generally, this would be the equivalent of a bachelor's degree + one year and would require five years' progressive experience to qualify under the 2nd preference (EB-2) category. 6. Three-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree (India) + five years' progressive, post-master's degree experience generally, the educational degrees would be determined to be the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's + one year and the beneficiary would meet the statutory requirement. 7. Three-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree + one-year postgraduate diploma (India) generally, this would be the equivalent of a bachelor's degree + one year and would require five years' progressive experience to qualify under the 2nd preference category (EB-2). If the postgraduate diploma is determined to be progressive postgraduate education that is a continuation of the three-year bachelor's degree or the two-year master's degree, it is possible that this would be considered the equivalent to a U.S. master's degree, and there would be no need to establish five years' progressive experience. The petition must include documentation, such as an official academic record showing that the alien has a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that the alien has a U.S. baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that the alien has at least five years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience in the specialty. The post-baccalaureate experience should reflect increasing or advancing levels of responsibility and knowledge in the specialty. The profession should be an occupation for which a baccalaureate degree or its foreign equivalent is the minimum requirement for the entry in the field.\"}\n",
