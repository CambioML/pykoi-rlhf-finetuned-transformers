does it need another i-485 application or just a letter to uscis?', 'Answer': \"you can always go up and you can always go down as long as your perm was filed as an eb-2. if you filed your prm as an eb-3 then you're not going to be able to upgrade to eb-2. but if your perm was filed as an eb-2 you can downgrade i-140 eb-3. you can go back upgrade toeb-2if you already have aneb-2approval. you can file a downgrade second case aseb-3with the sameperm.faq in detail...\"}, {'Question': 'how can i qualify for eb-1c/international managers or executives . i was in usa on h1b for 11 yrs until august 2019 as senior software engineer and moved/transferred to canada on september 2019 as software development manager, managing 5 direct reports plus 4 second level reports with the same company in usa and canada. and now promoted as director, software development projects support and maintenance, before completing one year as manager. have i-140 approved and priority date is 2012 july.<br>1.what is my success rate of getting l1a<br>2. also need to re-apply my green card in eb1c, do i need to be in usa or when i am in canada my company can apply for this. and upon eb1c i-140 approval can i get l1a and move to usa<br>3. is this the correct time to apply eb1c in the next couple of months when 1 year completes or should i wait for visa ban to complete.', 'Answer': \"1. please discuss your job description that is intended in the foreign country outside usa with your lawyers. make sure you plan for it from day one because if you try to plan for it a year down the line you won't succeed.\"}, {'Question': \"downgrading from eb-2 to eb-3 . my wife and i are currently on ead's since feb 2012 when the dates became current for our priority date and we were able to apply for the i-485. she is the primary applicant and i am the dependent on her application. since 2012 the ead/ap card is being renewed every 2 years. with the eb3 category now going ahead of eb2 does it make sense for her to downgrade to eb3 - apply for i-140 under eb3. i believe it takes 6 months for approval so we would essentially be doing this preemptively in anticipation of our date becoming current under eb3 in 6+ months.\", 'Answer': 'i see no problem applying for eb-3 and then using whichever one is faster when the time comes.'}, {'Question': \"how to get h-1b approved for three years, not shorter duration . 1. i got my h1b approved for a period of one year only and expires on oct 27th, 2019. i work through a consultancy. any precautions i can take in the future which can help me getting the h1b approved for 3 years in the upcoming h1b extension after oct 27th, 2019. <br>2. any particular documents needed for getting the h1b approved for 3 years?<br>3. if i go for stamping, do i need to be careful with social media at the port of entry?

can i-485 also denied? if newly filed i-140 (eb3) denied, can i used my previously approved i-140 (eb2)?', 'Answer': \"if we have an eb-2 approved i-140 we apply for an eb-3 approval on the same form or you can file eb-3 i-140 and i-485 concurrently if the dates are current. if you file a i-485 that is prematurely filed when the priority date of eb-2 is not current, if eb-3 is denied on which basis you had filed the i-485 then the i-485 will also be denied. i would want your lawyers to review your case very carefully. make sure that you don't have any other issues. if the second eb-3 filing gets denied it should not have any impact on the already approved i-140 unless the second filing reveals some problem with the case that was not addressed earlier.\"}]\n"

      "\"_answer\": \"In June 2007, the USCIS clarified what is considered to be equivalent to a U.S. master's degree for Employment-Based Category 2. Each petition and its supporting documentation are examined on a case-by-case basis and degree equivalencies are based on the evidence presented with the individual case. However, the below is provided as a general outline: 1. U.S. master's degree as long as it is in the field required, no additional document is required. 2. Four-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree (India) with degrees in the same or related fields, this will generally be considered the equivalent to a U.S. master's degree and no additional document is required. 3. Three-year bachelor's degree + three-year master's degree (India) with degrees in the same or related fields, this will generally be equivalent to a U.S. master's degree and no additional document is required. 4. Three-year bachelor's degree + one-year postgraduate diploma + two-year master's degree (India) with degrees in the same or similar field - this would generally be considered the equivalent of a bachelor's degree plus one additional year of education. Therefore, the beneficiary would also need to have five years' progressive experience. If the postgraduate diploma is determined to be progressive postgraduate education that is a continuation of the three-year bachelor's degree, it is possible that this would be considered the equivalent to a U.S. master's degree and there would be no need to establish five years' progressive experience. 5. Three-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree (India) generally, this would be the equivalent of a bachelor's degree + one year and would require five years' progressive experience to qualify under the 2nd preference (EB-2) category. 6. Three-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree (India) + five years' progressive, post-master's degree experience generally, the educational degrees would be determined to be the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's + one year and the beneficiary would meet the statutory requirement. 7. Three-year bachelor's degree + two-year master's degree + one-year postgraduate diploma (India) generally, this would be the equivalent of a bachelor's degree + one year and would require five years' progressive experience to qualify under the 2nd preference category (EB-2). If the postgraduate diploma is determined to be progressive postgraduate education that is a continuation of the three-year bachelor's degree or the two-year master's degree, it is possible that this would be considered the equivalent to a U.S. master's degree, and there would be no need to establish five years' progressive experience. The petition must include documentation, such as an official academic record showing that the alien has a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that the alien has a U.S. baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that the alien has at least five years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience in the specialty. The post-baccalaureate experience should reflect increasing or advancing levels of responsibility and knowledge in the specialty. The profession should be an occupation for which a baccalaureate degree or its foreign equivalent is the minimum requirement for the entry in the field.\"}\n",
